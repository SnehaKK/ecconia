# Effect of Climate Change on Indian Agriculture (ECConIA)

ECConIA is a project undertaken as part of the CMPE 239 - Web and Data Mining class at San Jose State University.

The aim of this project is to study the impact of climatic changes on Indian Agriculture. We have studied different reports and tried to account for different parameters into our study. Different algorithms are used to predict changes and influencers on the agriculture sector of India. We also quantified the measures to be taken for minimizing the losses.
